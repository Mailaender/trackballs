Basic Installation
==================

   These are generic installation instructions.

   The build system used for Trackballs is CMake. The required libraries
or standards are:

   SDL >=2.0.1 (also need SDL_mixer SDL_image SDL_ttf)
   libGL (OpenGL standard 3.3 or greater)
   Guile >=2.0.0 
   libz
   libm
   gettext
   
The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code. Type
     `mkdir build' to create a directory within which to build Trackballs.
     After `cd build', running `cmake ../' will generate the make 
     system. To specify an install prefix, use 
                     cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX ../
     Error messages at this stage typically indicate missing libraries.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package. Error messages indicating
     a failure to find a header may result from libraries that are missing
     and that the CMake script either did not check for or incorrectly
     configured. To see what commands are being executed, add the CMake
     command line flag "-DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON" in step 1.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.
